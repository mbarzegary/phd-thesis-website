<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">3D-printed orthopedic implants have been gaining popularity in recent years due to this manufacturing technique giving the designer control over the different design aspects of the implant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="bib.html#bib229" title="Impact of three dimensional printing in orthopedics" class="ltx_ref">151</a>, <a href="bib.html#bib230" title="3D printable biomaterials for orthopedic implants: solution for sustainable and circular economy" class="ltx_ref">287</a>]</cite>. It allows manufacturing implants with specific designs and using material properties similar to the bone, allowing the implant designer to address complications experienced in various surgeries such as total hip arthroplasty (THA). The implants used in THA consist of three main components: a femoral stem, a liner and an acetabular component, which comprises a cup and a solid (or porous) part behind. In large bone defects and severe deformations, the acetabular component can be designed and made patient-specific, an example of which is shown in Fig. <a href="#footnote1" title="footnote 1 ‣ Figure 10.1 ‣ 10.1 Introduction ‣ Chapter 10 Model applications: patient-specific porous acetabular implants ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (Ortho Baltic Implants Co., Lithuania). This patient-specific design has certain advantages such as decreased mechanical instability risk, adaptation of the implant shape to the patient’s bone geometry, restoring the biomechanics of the joint after the severe fractures, and optimal positioning of the screws.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Although such a patient-specific design helps surgeons address multiple problems in the first place, other issues may emerge during revision surgeries, an example of which is the aseptic loosening of the implant after THA. The rate and quality of bone regeneration after implantation of orthopedic implants depends significantly on the achieved (initial and long-term) mechanical stability. To restore proper function after the implant loosening, the implant needs to be replaced. During these revision surgeries, some bone is removed along with the implant, further increasing the already present bone defects and making it harder to achieve proper mechanical stability with the revision implant <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="bib.html#bib228" title="Magnesium-based implants: a mini-review" class="ltx_ref">177</a>]</cite>. A possible way to limit the increasing loss of bone is using (partially) biodegradable orthopedic implants that optimize long-term implant stability, in which part of the implant, like the irregular patient-specific part behind the acetabular cup in Fig. <a href="#footnote1" title="footnote 1 ‣ Figure 10.1 ‣ 10.1 Introduction ‣ Chapter 10 Model applications: patient-specific porous acetabular implants ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, is made from biodegradable metals. This means that the biodegradable part of the implant will disappear and be replaced by newly formed bone during the implant’s lifetime. Taking advantage of these implants needs to optimize the implant so that stress shielding is minimized and tune the implant degradation rate so that newly formed bone can replace the degrading metal to maintain proper bone-implant contact. The hope is that such (partly) degradable implants will lead to a reduction in the size of the bone defects over time, making possible future revisions less likely and less complex.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In this study, we focused on improving the long-term implant stability of patient-specific acetabular implants for large bone defects and tuning their biodegradable behavior. To improve the long-term implant stability, a surrogate-based optimization approach was implemented that sought to reduce implant-induced stress shielding by adjusting the stiffness of an acetabular implant. The optimized stiffness was subsequently translated into a porous implant design of varying porosity. In the initial stage of developing a computational workflow containing both the patient-specific optimization routine and the biodegradation model, the geometry of the acetabular component of the implant was assumed to be only the cup by ignoring the additional back-parts, all of which is designed to be porous and made from biodegradable materials (Fig. <a href="#F2" title="Figure 10.2 ‣ 10.1 Introduction ‣ Chapter 10 Model applications: patient-specific porous acetabular implants ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10.2</span></a>). Although this assumption was made for demonstration purposes and simplifying the geometry of the optimization model, the workflow can be applied to the full acetabular implant setup consisting of a cup-shaped non-degradable part (combined with a polyethylene cup) and a patient-specific porous degradable part matching the patient’s bone geometry in the future.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">A quantitative mathematical model of the degradation process is a useful tool for tuning the biodegradation and material release rate, allowing researchers to study the biodegradation behavior of any desired implant <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">in silico</span> (in the computer) prior to conducting any <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">in vitro</span> or <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">in vivo</span> experiments. Developed mathematical models can be simulated using efficient numerical schemes such as the finite element method. The primary challenge here will be achieving a high numerical accuracy at the interface between the implant and surrounding tissue in the body since the interface plays an important role in the degradation phenomena. Increased accuracy means increased computational cost and resources (especially time), but high-performance computing (HPC) techniques can be used to overcome this challenge.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Two patient-specific finite elements (FE) models of the hip joint, i.e., one with implant and one without, were derived from computed tomography (CT) scans of the pelvis, implemented using MARC/MENTAT software (Perez-Boerema et al., in preparation). The elastic modulus of the implant was parametrized, making use of two paraboloids, one for the upper half of the acetabular implant and one for the lower half. The FE model of the hip joint with implant was then used to generate a surrogate model by first applying a principal component analysis (PCA) in order to reduce the size of the output space and subsequently constructing a radial basis function (RBF) surrogate, implemented in MATLAB. The resulting surrogate model was used in a multi-start local optimization routine that relied on sequential quadratic programming to perform the local optimizations. The optimization had as objective minimizing the difference in stresses between the physiological control (no implant) and the case with implant. The coefficients of the paraboloids used to parametrize the elastic modulus were taken to be the design variables. The elastic modulus was limited to values between 1.2 and 110 GPa, while implant stresses were constrained to at most 0.3 times the yield stress. The optimized stiffness distribution was subsequently used to design an acetabular implant with a local porosity chosen to match the optimized global stiffness distribution. To this end, the open-source tool ASLI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="bib.html#bib161" title="A flexible and easy-to-use open-source tool for designing functionally graded 3d porous structures" class="ltx_ref">207</a>]</cite> was developed in-house, facilitating the generation of a skeletal-gyroid-based infill of varying porosity that can be tuned to match a predefined (in this case, the optimized) stiffness.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">In this application chapter, we apply the previously developed quantitative mathematical model capturing the biodegradation of magnesium-based implants (Chapter <a href="Ch3.html" title="Chapter 3 Developing the core computational model ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>). Magnesium (Mg) was selected to start with due to its acceptable mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and contribution to osteoinductivity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="bib.html#bib206" title="Biodegradable magnesium alloys for orthopaedic applications: a review on corrosion, biocompatibility and surface modifications" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. The developed model captures the release of Mg ions, the formation of a protective film, the dissolution of this film due to the presence of various ions in the surrounding environment, and the change in pH. This was accomplished by deriving a system of nonlinear time-dependent reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) from the underlying oxidation-reduction reactions occurring during the biodegradation process of metallic materials in simulated body fluid. The level-set formalism was employed to track the movement of the biodegradation front between the implant and its surroundings. The equations were solved implicitly using the finite element method for spatial terms (with a 1st order Lagrange polynomial as the shape function) and backward-Euler finite difference method for temporal terms on an Eulerian mesh, implemented in the open-source PDE solver FreeFEM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="bib.html#bib44" title="New development in freefem++" class="ltx_ref">112</a>]</cite>. The details of this model can be found in Chapter <a href="Ch3.html" title="Chapter 3 Developing the core computational model ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="bib.html#bib109" title="Computational modeling of degradation process of biodegradable magnesium biomaterials" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.

Mass loss is one of the commonly-used indicators for the degradation rate, demonstrating that the biodegradation rate is much higher in the non-buffered solution. Although evaluated on different geometries with certain effect on the results, loss of material over time was found to be comparatively in line with the values obtained in Chapter <a href="Ch3.html" title="Chapter 3 Developing the core computational model ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="bib.html#bib109" title="Computational modeling of degradation process of biodegradable magnesium biomaterials" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, with the mass loss in the saline solution being 6 to 10 times more than that of buffered solution in evaluated time points before 21 hours. It shows that scaling the model in an HPC environment does not affect the quantitative predictions made by the model. The developed mechanistic model of the biodegradation process includes a level-set equation correlating the loss of material to the velocity at which the implant interface shrinks. The aforementioned agreement of results on a large scale (a model with <math id="S3.SS2.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics><mo>∼</mo><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>45M elements) shows that the interface tracking formulation behaves efficiently even in problems with a high level of details.

The concentration is directly correlated to the exposed surface area, meaning that a higher surface-to-volume ratio results in a higher material release.

<p class="ltx_p">Regarding the clinical interpretation of the obtained results, it is worth reminding that the simulated cup is a simplified version of the acetabular component of the implant. In real-case scenarios, this component contains a patient-specific part on the back that can be manufactured from biodegradable materials (shown in Fig. <a href="#footnote1" title="footnote 1 ‣ Figure 10.1 ‣ 10.1 Introduction ‣ Chapter 10 Model applications: patient-specific porous acetabular implants ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>). In order to simplify the geometry construction and the optimization procedure, the shape of the patient-specific component was neglected and was assumed to be the cup instead (Fig. <a href="#F2" title="Figure 10.2 ‣ 10.1 Introduction ‣ Chapter 10 Model applications: patient-specific porous acetabular implants ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10.2</span></a>), which should be created from non-degradable materials in real applications to provide enough support for fixing the implant behind the polyethylene liner. As a result, the simulation results cannot be used directly for clinical interpretation. However, by only changing the geometry construction from the CT scans performed for the surrogate-based optimization model, the whole workflow can be applied for the patient-specific design of acetabular implants in more clinical-relevant cases.</p>

It was expected to observe different scaling behavior for models depending on the size of the problem as in problems with smaller sizes, the costs associated with inter-nodes communication become effective faster in comparison to bigger models. However, no significant difference was observed here, and all three problem sizes show very similar behavior in the parallel efficiency plots (Fig. <a href="#F11" title="Figure 10.11 ‣ 10.3.3 Scaling tests on the computational models ‣ 10.3 Results and discussion ‣ Chapter 10 Model applications: patient-specific porous acetabular implants ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10.11</span></a>), demonstrating the non-ideal behavior of the developed model in terms of efficient usage of available computing resources.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Although the executed performance analysis showed poor parallel efficiency in higher number of CPU cores, it was necessary to reveal the weaknesses of the developed model in this regard. The weak and strong scaling results and the parallel efficiency graphs clearly indicate that the code can be improved from the performance point of view. Given the current state of HPC for biomedical-related simulations and computational modeling works, even taking 10K CPU cores is not unrealistic. The first part of improvement seems to be related to assembling the linear system, in which the schemes used for numerical integration, the order of elements used for various involved physics, and the method for applying boundary conditions play an essential role. Secondly, the configuration of employed preconditioners and iterative solvers can be modified for individual components according to the numerical computing requirements, which can affect their scaling behavior (Fig. <a href="#F9" title="Figure 10.9 ‣ 10.3.3 Scaling tests on the computational models ‣ 10.3 Results and discussion ‣ Chapter 10 Model applications: patient-specific porous acetabular implants ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10.9</span></a>). Thirdly, the load balancing issues caused by the mathematical problem formulation, in which the system has nothing to solve in regions still in the solid block, seem to contribute to the poor parallel performance. This can be improved by revising the mathematical and computational problem definition from the load-balancing perspective. However, making a more tangible conclusion on the performance bottlenecks of the developed model requires further analysis of the results for the parallel speedup, similar to the analysis performed in Chapter <a href="Ch7.html" title="Chapter 7 Model parallelization for high-performance computing ‣ Mathematical and computational modeling of metallic biomaterials biodegradation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="bib.html#bib110" title="Highly scalable numerical simulation of coupled reaction–diffusion systems with moving interfaces" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, it should be taken into account that such performance analysis has an inherent simplification of more complex technical aspects affecting the simulation execution time, such as load balancing, network communication, and per-node limitations in memory access, which may differ in each HPC environment due to the configurations made by the system maintainers.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In this work, taking advantage of HPC techniques to simulate a large-scale 3D model led to a computational model capable of predicting the biodegradation behavior of an acetabular implant in high resolution. Results demonstrate the potential of the model to act as a tool for assessing and tuning the biodegradation properties of orthopedic implants regardless of shape or complexity.</p>
